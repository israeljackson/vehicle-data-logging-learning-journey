Vehicle Data Logging – Learning Journey

This repository is a growing collection of my Python projects from my Python Telemetry Engineering learning roadmap.
I’m learning how to build data pipelines, simulate sensor data, and create simple logging systems using Python as preparation for full vehicle telemetry workflows.

The projects here include:

  Vehicle telemetry data (JSON and CSV)
  
  A basic Python telemetry logger
  
  A “buggy” telemetry version I debugged and improved
  
  Multi-user data logging system
  
  Temperature logger and converter
  
  Simple calculators and OOP practice files
  
  Dice simulations
  
  Contact book and grade calculator
  
  General Python experiments as I build confidence with data handling

Each file represents a stage of my progress as I learn:

  How to work with CSV and JSON
  
  How to structure Python scripts
  
  How to simulate data
  
  How to debug and refactor code
  
  How to build toward a full telemetry pipeline
  
This repository will continue to grow as I complete more lessons and move toward the full Vehicle Telemetry System (simulator → logger → viewer → SQLite database).
