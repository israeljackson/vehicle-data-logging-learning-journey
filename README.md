# Vehicle Data Logging – Learning Journey

This repository contains my practical projects from my Python Telemetry Engineering roadmap.  
I’m learning how to build data pipelines, sensor simulations, and simple logging systems using Python.

The projects inside the `projects/` folder include:
- Vehicle telemetry data (JSON and CSV)
- A basic Python telemetry logger
- A “buggy” telemetry version I debugged and improved
- Multi-user data logging system
- Temperature logger and converter
- Simple calculators and OOP practice files
- Dice simulations
- Contact book and grade calculator
- General Python experiments as I build confidence with data handling

This repo will continue to grow as I complete more lessons and build the full Vehicle Telemetry System (simulator → logger → viewer → SQLite database).
