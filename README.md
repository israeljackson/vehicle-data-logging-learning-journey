# Vehicle Data Logging – Learning Journey

This repository contains my practical projects from my Python Telemetry Engineering roadmap.  
I’m learning how to build data pipelines, sensor simulations, and simple logging systems using Python.

# vehicle-data-logging-learning-journey
A collection of my Python projects from my telemetry and data-logging learning roadmap.

This repository contains my practical projects from my Python Telemetry Engineering roadmap.  
I’m learning how to build data pipelines, sensors simulations, and simple logging systems using Python.

The projects here include:
>>>>>>> 607d48f84400b7164f32a785f89ab4cc375205a6
- Vehicle telemetry data (JSON and CSV)
- A basic Python telemetry logger
- A “buggy” telemetry version I debugged and improved
- Multi-user data logging system
- Temperature logger and converter
- Simple calculators and OOP practice files
- Dice simulations
- Contact book and grade calculator
- General Python experiments as I build confidence with data handling

Each file shows a stage of my progress as I learn:
- How to work with CSV/JSON  
- How to structure Python scripts  
- How to simulate data  
- How to debug and refactor code  
- How to build toward a full telemetry pipeline  

>>>>>>> 607d48f84400b7164f32a785f89ab4cc375205a6
This repo will continue to grow as I complete more lessons and build the full Vehicle Telemetry System (simulator → logger → viewer → SQLite database).
